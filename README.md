# PhoenixFoodMockUp
This is a mock up web page for an Chinese American food website I created. While most of it is under construction. The front landing page is mostly done.

## Technologies
This webpage was designed with Bootstrap 5.1.3 and a small amount of custom CSS. The backend is suppose to be designed with ASP.NET, .NET6, but
full functionality of the website is under-construction. Website is deployed with Azure with SQL database in mind for future functionality.

## Why make this ‚ùî
I made this webpage with several intentions...
 - To begin learning ASP.NET
 - Kinda of mix in some of my knowledge of web dev with C#
 - Just a side fun project for learning üòé
